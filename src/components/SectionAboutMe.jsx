        <p>
          Hi, Iâ€™m <span>Ana</span>, a <span>Web Developer</span> with a strong <span>UI/UX</span> foundation. I've had the opportunity to work in UI/UX with brands like Canonical Ubuntu and Redbility (Inditex), and as an assistant professor in Interaction and Interface Design at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.
        </p>
        <p>I hold a degree in <span>Digital Interaction Techniques and Multimedia (where I delved into programming and design)</span> and a <span>Masterâ€™s in User Experience Design</span>. Recently, I completed <span>Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp</span> with a full scholarship from Universia to refresh and deepen my programming skills. This journey culminated in a collaborative final project selected to participate in the upcoming Hackshow showcase.</p>
        <p>
          <span>My goal?</span> To build user-centered digital experiences that
          blend solid coding with engaging design.
        </p>
